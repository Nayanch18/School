                        our students. During a special morning assembly, teachers performed
                        for the students in order to express their unconditional love for them.The students were
                        overwhelmed with the entire effort and gave standing ovations. The
                        campus was buzzing with excitement and joy as students received a
                        wrist band as a token of love. The day ended with beautiful memories
